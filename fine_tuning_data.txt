T(x,1) = 0

                        If we increase the coefficient of π in the force function, what will happen to the temperature distribution?
Response: Increasing the coefficient of π will amplify the source term, proportionally raising the temperature. At (0, 0), the temperature might increase from solution_array[0, 0] to solution_array[0, 0] * 2 if the coefficient doubles.

Prompt: Case2Q1: Analyze this steady-state heat equation solution
                        ∂²T/∂x² + ∂²T/∂y² = 0
                        Initial and Boundary Conditions:
T(0,y) = 0
T(1,y) = 0
T(x,0) = 0
T(x,1) = sin(πx)

                        Explain why the temperature is zero at both x=0 and x=1, and what this means physically.
Response: The temperature is zero at both x=0 and x=1 because the boundary conditions T(0,y) = 0 and T(1,y) = 0 are applied. This enforces that along the vertical edges of the domain, the temperature remains zero, indicating insulated or perfectly conducting boundaries. Physically, this represents a situation where no heat flows in or out at these boundaries, maintaining zero temperature throughout.

Prompt: Case2Q2: Analyze this steady-state heat equation solution
                        ∂²T/∂x² + ∂²T/∂y² = 0
                        Initial and Boundary Conditions:

T(1,y) = 0
T(x,0) = 0
T(x,1) = sin(πx)

                        At what coordinates does the maximum temperature occur, and what determines this location?
Response: The maximum temperature in the solution array is solution_array.max(), and it occurs at the coordinate {divmod(solution_array.argmax(), solution_array.shape[1])}. This location is determined by the boundary condition T(x,1) = sin(πx), which causes the temperature to peak near the top boundary where the sine function has its highest values, specifically at x=0.5.

Prompt: Case2Q3: Analyze this steady-state heat equation solution
                        ∂²T/∂x² + ∂²T/∂y² = 0
                        Initial and Boundary Conditions:
T(0,y) = 0
T(1,y) = 0
T(x,0) = 0
T(x,1) = sin(πx)

                        How does the temperature profile change along the vertical line x=0.5 compared to x=0.25?
Response: The temperature profile along the vertical line x=0.5 is: {solution_array[solution_array.shape[0] // 2, y]' for y in range(solution_array.shape[1]))}. The profile along the vertical line x=0.25 is: {solution_array[solution_array.shape[0] // 4, y]' for y in range(solution_array.shape[1]))}. The temperature is generally higher along the line x=0.5 than along x=0.25 because the sine boundary condition T(x,1) = sin(πx) leads to a larger contribution to the temperature near x=0.5, where the sine function peaks.

                        What is the temperature at the corner (0, 0) of the unit square mesh?
Response: The temperature at the corner (0, 0) is solution_array[0, 0], as computed from the solution array. This value is influenced by the boundary conditions applied at the edges of the domain, where the corner point has minimal exposure to the heat source and is constrained by the surrounding temperature distribution.

Prompt: Case3Q2: Analyze this transient heat equation solution
                        ∂²T/∂x² + ∂²T/∂y² = 0
                        Boundary Conditions:

T(1,y) = y(1-y)
T(x,0) = 0
T(x,1) = 0

                        What physical significance does the boundary condition u(0,y)=0 have in the context of heat diffusion on the unit square mesh?
Response: The boundary condition u(0, y) = 0 at x = 0 implies that the temperature along the left edge of the unit square is fixed to zero. This condition represents an insulated or perfectly conducting boundary where no heat flows in or out. Physically, this suggests that the system maintains a constant temperature (zero in this case) along the left boundary, which influences the overall temperature distribution throughout the domain.

Prompt: Case3Q3: Analyze this transient heat equation solution
                        ∂²T/∂x² + ∂²T/∂y² = 0
                        Boundary Conditions:

T(1,y) = y(1-y)
T(x,0) = 0
T(x,1) = 0

                        What does the boundary condition u(1,y)=y(1-y) represent physically in this heat diffusion problem?
Response: The boundary condition u(1, y) = y(1 - y) at x = 1 defines a parabolic temperature distribution along the right edge of the domain. This condition represents a situation where the temperature varies quadratically with y, starting from 0 at y = 0, peaking at y = 0.5, and returning to 0 at y = 1. Physically, this can represent a heat source that varies with position along the right boundary, with the highest temperature in the middle and decreasing temperatures towards the top and bottom edges.

Prompt: Case4Q1: Analyze this transient heat equation solution
                        ∂T/∂t = ∂²T/∂x² + ∂²T/∂y²
                        Boundary Conditions:
T(x,y,0) = sin(πx)sin(πy)
T(0,y,t) = 0

T(x,0,t) = 0
T(x,1,t) = 0

                        What can you infer about the decay rate of temperature?
Response: The decay rate of temperature is governed by the parameter α and the initial temperature distribution. In this case, the temperature decays exponentially with time due to the diffusion process described by the heat equation. Physically, the exponential decay ensures that the temperature distribution flattens out as the system approaches thermal equilibrium, with no heat flux at the boundaries.

Prompt: Case4Q2: Analyze this transient heat equation solution
                        ∂T/∂t = ∂²T/∂x² + ∂²T/∂y²
                        Boundary Conditions:
T(x,y,0) = sin(πx)sin(πy)
T(0,y,t) = 0
T(1,y,t) = 0
T(x,0,t) = 0
T(x,1,t) = 0

                        Comment on the physical interpretation of why the spatial pattern remains unchanged while only the amplitude decreases with time?
Response: The spatial pattern remains unchanged because the initial condition T(x,y,0) = sin(πx)sin(πy) represents the fundamental mode of the heat equation, and higher-order modes are absent in this setup. The amplitude decreases with time because the heat dissipates uniformly throughout the domain, causing the temperature values to reduce exponentially while preserving the shape of the initial temperature distribution.

Prompt: Case4Q3: Analyze this transient heat equation solution
                        ∂T/∂t = ∂²T/∂x² + ∂²T/∂y²
                        Boundary Conditions:

T(x,1,t) = 0

                        What is the effect of alpha on the deacy rate of heat dissipation?
Response: The parameter α directly affects the decay rate of heat dissipation. A larger α results in faster diffusion, causing the temperature to decay more rapidly. Conversely, a smaller α slows down the diffusion process, leading to a slower decay of temperature over time. In this setup, with α = 0.01, the diffusion is relatively slow, resulting in gradual dissipation of heat as time progresses.
